1. Installation

1. Direct => Docker uses the kernel and the OS i.e. Docker supports that OS. Linux, Windows Server 16 etc supports docker natively.
2. Not Direct => Mac and Windows 10 => Suite of tools including GUI and settings available to use docker but not supported natively on these. Uses one virtual machine to run containers on it.
3. Clouds => Docker for AWS is example => Docker for this offers other features like using it with AWS volume etc => specific to vendor like AWS 


MAC INSTALLATION: https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop

1. Dont use brew as it install CLI which is used to talk to remote server which we wont do much in this course.
2. Docker Toolbox => for old MAC OS => 10.6-10.8
3. You can download virtual box to bring up linux VM and run your docker on that.
4. Might throw error on installation => Open docker from Applications folder and it should work.

On top icon, click and open Prefrences => 

File sharing => Make sure that your code which you are using should be in one of these volumes 

Advanced => Mac is actually running a tiny Linux VM because docker doesn't run natively on Mac kernel. Apple hasn't added support for it. Like any VM, you can give RAM and CPU => whatever resources you are giving, docker only use to full capacity if needed. Otherwise, other apps on Mac can share those resources.

Iterm2 for terminal is good to install
Download Microsoft Visual Studio and Docker extension in it
brew install bash-completion => this helps in completing docker commands using TAB => Follow this afterwards => https://docs.docker.com/compose/completion/ => See for zsh
