4. Containers vs VMs

Container is a kinda restricted process running on your host operating system like Linux and not some VM kind of thing. If you run a mongo image:

docker run --name mongo -d mongo and do "docker top mongo" to see processes running under container => You will see mongo process. On your host OS, if you list its own processes using "ps aux"=> This mongo process will show up there also maybe with different PID though.  

Had container be a VM, the process would be hidden by the VM and not show up on your host OS. 

Read more about this on: Resources of 21 Video 
Also read about 22 => Windows containers 
Also some more resources in previous sections on container commands etc are there.


Also, container does not have an OS or kernel or drivers and that's how it is different from the Virtual machine which has its own kernel and operating system.
